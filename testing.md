# Testing

## HTML validator

## CSS validator
I inputted code into the W3C validation service, initially this brought up two errors
- Text-shadow format was not correct, I decided the text shadow of the text over the hero image was not neccessary so removed that.
- Font weight value was incorrect, I had used 200px instead of 200.
Once these errors were corrected no further errors were found.
