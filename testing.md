# Testing

## HTML validator
### Home page
![Screenshot of HTML validation results for home page](readme-img/html-home.png)
- For error 1, I replaced the name attribute with an id attribute.
- For error 2, this was the only way I found in providing textual context to the background image as the image itself was within CSS. I removed this as the image is not providing any information to the user. 
- For error 3 and 4 I changed the buttons to links.

### Routes page
![Screenshot of HTML validation results for route page](readme-img/html-routes.png)
- For error 1, I replaced the name attribute with an id attribute.
- For error 2, this was the only way I found in providing textual context to the background image as the image itself was within CSS. I removed this as the image is not providing any information to the user. 
- For error 3-6, I removed the id attributes as they were not needed, as there was already a class attribute.

### Get in touch page
![Screenshot of HTML validation results for get in touch page](readme-img/html-touch.png)

- For error 1, I replaced the name attribute with an id attribute.
- For error 2, this was the only way I found in providing textual context to the background image as the image itself was within CSS. I removed this as the image is not providing any information to the user. 
- For error 3 and 4 I removed the br elements within the unordered list.

I corrected each error and re-checked the HTML through the validator, and it passed.

## CSS validator
I inputted code into the W3C validation service, initially this brought up two errors
- Text-shadow format was not correct, I decided the text shadow of the text over the hero image was not neccessary so removed that.
- Font weight value was incorrect, I had used 200px instead of 200.
- Once these errors were corrected no further errors were found.

## Performance testing
I utilised the [Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/) performance testing software.
- The results of the lighthouse testing can be seen below for each page. 
- On the first round of testing, the performace was quite low due to image size and bootstrap stylesheets slowing down the first paint of the page.
- I reduced the size of the images and used [Tinypng](https://tinypng.com/) to compress the images. As you can see below, the doing this increased the performance significantly. 
- The accessibility is good although not 100%, this wil be looked into in more detail in the next section.
- The search engine optimisation is good but slightly low due to the link to bring the user back up to the top of the page being unrawlable.

## Accessability testing
I utilised [Wave](https://wave.webaim.org/) which is a web accessibility evaluation tool.

- One error was detected, that an empty button was present. This was the collapsable hamburger navbar button, which was adapted from Bootstrap documentation. It works well so I decided to leave it as it is, however will consider that in future projects.
- The contrast ratio was good throughout and passed the tests for normal and large text, apart from the testimonial cards, so I made the background colour darker to increase readability, it then passed the tests.
- The social media links within the footer did not all have titles, this error was corrected.

## Responsiveness
- I utilised Chrome Developer tools to test responsiveness on different devices, the following devices were succesfully tested through this.
    - iPhone SE
    - iPhone XR
    - iPhone 6/7/8
    - Samsung galaxy S8+
    - iPad Air
    - iPad Mini
    - Surface pro 7
    - Galaxy Fold
    - Nest Hub

- I manually tested the website on an iPhone 12 pro, an iPad 2 and a MacBook Air.

## Identified bugs

- Bug: On the routes page I noticed that when clicking left or right on the second or third carousel it was controlling the first and not the one that was being clicked.
- How I fixed it: I realised that each carousel had the same id as I had copied and pasted without realising, once this was corrected the error was solved.

- Bug: The text on the get in touch page, explaining the next steps, when viewed on a mobile device was slightly off centre to the right.
- How I fixed it: I changed the text from an unordered list with list items, to individual paragraphs, and this allowed the text to be aligned to the centre.

- Bug: When viewed on smaller screen sizes the carousel images appeared unequal in size.
- How I fixed it: I used an image resizer to make sure images had the same dimensions.
