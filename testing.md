## HTML validator
### Home page
![Screenshot of HTML validation results for home page]()
- For error 1, I replaced the name attribute with an id attribute.
- For error 2, this was the only way I found in providing textual context to the background image as the image itself was within CSS.
- For error 3 and 4 I changed the buttons to links.

### Routes page

- For error 1, I replaced the name attribute with an id attribute.
- For error 2, this was the only way I found in providing textual context to the background image as the image itself was within CSS.
- For error 3-6, I removed the id attributes as they were not needed, as there was already a class attribute.

## CSS validator
I inputted code into the W3C validation service, initially this brought up two errors
- Text-shadow format was not correct, I decided the text shadow of the text over the hero image was not neccessary so removed that.
- Font weight value was incorrect, I had used 200px instead of 200.
Once these errors were corrected no further errors were found.
